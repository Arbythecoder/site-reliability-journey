# Week 2 ‚Äì Service Crash Simulation with Bash + systemd

## üß† What I Learned  
- **Systemd services** allow you to manage long-running processes like background services (daemons).
- Using a simple **Bash script**, I can simulate a crashing service by randomly exiting with an error code.
- This is useful for practicing **monitoring**, **auto-restart logic**, and **resilience testing**.
- Learned how to use `systemctl` to start, stop, and inspect services, as well as use `journalctl` for logs.

---

## üîß What I Did  
- Wrote a script called `crashing-service.sh` that randomly crashes to simulate unreliable behavior.  
- Wrote a `systemd` unit file called `crashing-service.service` to manage the script as a Linux service.  
- Tested service behavior by observing random failures and verifying auto-restart functionality.

## üìù How to Set It Up

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x crashing-service.sh
````

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Copy the service file to systemd directory

```bash
sudo cp crashing-service.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reload systemd to recognize the new service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the crashing service

```bash
sudo systemctl start crashing-service
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Enable it to start automatically on boot

```bash
sudo systemctl enable crashing-service
```

## üìã Sample Output from Script

You may see either of the following when the service runs:

```bash
[START] Tue Jul 8 18:42:00 UTC 2025: Service starting...
[OK] Running smoothly.
```

Or:

```bash
[START] Tue Jul 8 18:43:05 UTC 2025: Service starting...
[CRASH] Oops! Simulating crash...
```

The randomness is intentional to help simulate **flaky or unreliable services**.

## üí° Manage and Debug the Service

| Task         | Command                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Check status | `sudo systemctl status crashing-service`  |
| Stop service | `sudo systemctl stop crashing-service`    |
| Restart      | `sudo systemctl restart crashing-service` |
| View logs    | `journalctl -u crashing-service`          |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Gotchas

* **Permission:** All `systemctl` and `journalctl` commands require `sudo`.
* **Path matters:** Ensure the path in the `.service` file points to the actual location of your `crashing-service.sh`.
* **systemd may not run fully inside WSL** unless you're using systemd-enabled WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04+).
